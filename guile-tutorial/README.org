* Guile tutorial
  Let's try embedding guile in a C program:
  https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/docs/guile-tut/tutorial.html

  sudo apt install guile-2.0 guile-2.0-dev gnuplot

  Emacs packages: paredit, geiser

  Something seems to be wrong with my gnuplot setup on Ubuntu 17.10 --
  I cannot get the plotting from the guile REPL to work
  reliably. Anyway, invocation with `./tortoise -l koch-curve.scm`
  brings up a nice plot.
